<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">What is the main form of currency in your world? Do they trade in money, or do they barter goods and labour? Or something else entirely?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Think about what your currency is worth. How much does an apple cost, a horse, or a house? How much is a day’s wages, and how does that compare?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">What makes a currency’s value increase, or decrease? What might cause an economic crash in your world, and what might the consequences be?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">How about the economic structure in your world? Perhaps it’s a capitalist society, maybe people hoard money and resources. Maybe it’s communist, and everyone has an equal share. Perhaps it’s something else. Is it fair and equal, or is the system abused by some?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Where is money kept, and how is it accessed? Think about other ways that wealth may be safeguarded; in the purchase of land, or property, or businesses. Perhaps the purchase of other commodities. Maybe, through doing these things, other people are disadvantaged. Maybe they lose access to a forest vital for hunting and wood. Maybe they lose access to an ancestral homeland.</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">There’s little more personal than money, so remember to keep bringing it back to the character level.</span></p>
