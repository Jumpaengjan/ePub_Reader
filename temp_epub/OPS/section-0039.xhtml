There is no rule that says magic can only exist in fantasy novels, and it frequently makes an appearance in science-fiction, horror, and many other genres. The genre of your story can help to inform what kind of magic system you create.</span></p>

If you’re writing an epic fantasy, it might be nature-based magic, in urban-fantasy, it might be based on the moon. If you’re putting magic into a futuristic setting, it might be closely linked with technology and science.</span></p>

Look at ways in which you can tie your magic system to these things.</span></p>
