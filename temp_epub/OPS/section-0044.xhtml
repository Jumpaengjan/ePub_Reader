<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Your magic system should have limitations. If magic is limitless and all powerful, if magic can be easily used to solve every problem your characters face, then your scope for creating conflict in your story is much reduced.</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">If your magic system has limits, or your character’s use or knowledge of it has limits, then you can still put obstacles in the way of them achieving their goal. You can give them struggles, and put them in danger, and leave your readers wondering whether or not they will succeed.</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Think about some ways in which your magic can be limited, or your character’s use of it may be limited. Give your magic system rules and guidelines.</span></p>

Perhaps it can’t cure wounds, or mend machines. Maybe it requires silence and concentration to perform. Maybe each spell takes weeks of preparation.</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Create some limitations for your magic system, remembering to think about all of the things you’ve already written about it. Fit the limitations into your world just as carefully as you’ve fitted the magic itself. It all needs to tie together.</span></p>
