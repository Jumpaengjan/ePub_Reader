These varying kinds of magic may be practised by people in different areas, or different races, different genders, socio-economic groups, or species.</span></p>

Maybe they are encouraged down a particular magical path based on their competencies and talents. Maybe it’s based on their family’s traditions. Perhaps some magic systems are thought of as high-brow and respectable, while others are viewed as common and lowly.</span></p>

Or they may be more integrated, borrowing from one another, with people able to create their own magic mash-ups.</span></p>

They might bring about struggles for power, or genocide, or war. They may exist respectfully alongside one another. They might complement each other, working together to create a more powerful magic overall.</span></p>
