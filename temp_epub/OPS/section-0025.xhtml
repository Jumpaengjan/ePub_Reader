<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Closely related to family, are gender roles. Within the family environment, who is responsible for which domestic tasks? Outside of the home, how do gender roles play out in wider society; in education, in the workplace, in government?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Which gender-related qualities (or perceived qualities) are revered? Which are seen as weaknesses? And which are encouraged, which frowned upon, or, even, subject to punishment?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Does your world have gender equality, or is one gender held above another?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Perhaps there is a fluidity of gender, and maybe gender isn’t determined, or defined, in the same way it is in our world. There may well be several different genders, and these may be changeable over a person’s lifetime. How do they change, and how is this decided? Maybe there is no gender at all.</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Think about how all of this ties into the make-up of your world. Its culture, its values, and how it affects the individual characters. Especially if they don’t fit society’s perceived ‘norm’.</span></p>
