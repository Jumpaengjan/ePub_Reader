<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">As well as limitations on the magic itself, you can also raise the stakes, and the tension, by creating consequences for using magic.</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">These could be legal consequences; if they are likely to be arrested or tortured for publicly using magic. Perhaps they are faced with a dilemma where they need to use magic to save someone they love, but by doing so, they are condemning themselves to a death sentence.</span></p>

Perhaps it makes them sick, or they only have a certain amount of magic to use before it runs out completely. Maybe they have to drop their defences in order to attack, leaving them vulnerable.</span></p>

Or, if they use magic to halt a flood, another town is swamped with water. Perhaps all magic sent out into the world is returned to the user three-fold.</span></p>
