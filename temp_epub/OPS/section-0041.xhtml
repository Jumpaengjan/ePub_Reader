Is it available to everyone, or only to some? If only some people can practice magic, why is that? Perhaps it’s nature; that only certain races have magical powers. Or only specific genders, or ages, or perhaps it’s genetic, or completely random. Maybe some people aren’t allowed to practice magic based on society’s laws, or maybe they are barred from it for other reasons: geographical, socio-economic, physical limitations, etc.</span></p>

Perhaps they’ve had to say goodbye to their friends, their family, their home, their freedom. Maybe they’ve had to give up on their childhood, or any hope of having a ‘normal’ life. How do they feel about magic?</span></p>
