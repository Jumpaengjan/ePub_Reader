<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Think about the resources needed for magic. Do they need herbs and roots? Do they need to be able to see the stars clearly? Do they need to be near water, or rock, or ice? Are there places that enhance and strengthen their magic, and places that dampen and dull it?</span></p>

Perhaps magic cannot travel through rock. Perhaps it is useless in a blizzard. Perhaps the lights of the city block out the stars, or a particular herb is rare and expensive.</span></p>

Perhaps magicians require access to magical fighting arenas which are few and far between.</span></p>
