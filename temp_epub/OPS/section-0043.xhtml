<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Your magic system may require certain items to work at all; wands, mirrors, blades, herbs, rings, metals. Or these items may be ceremonial, needed for the rites and rituals to be carried out as per tradition.</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Think about the rarity, the value, and the cost of these items. Think about who has access to them, and who they are kept from. How dangerous are they, and what protections might someone need to handle them?</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">What would someone be willing to sacrifice to find, to keep, or to destroy an item?</span></p>
