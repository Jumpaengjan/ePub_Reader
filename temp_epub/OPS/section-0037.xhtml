You are now a deity in your own right, able to sit back and proudly survey the world that you have created. You’ve moulded it with your own hands from nothing. You imagined it, and now, here it is. Fresh, and new, and wonderful.</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span class="C_Current__And__Cambria">Look closely. Can you see all those little people walking about down there? They’re the important ones. And you’re about to give them one hell of an adventure.</span></p>
