<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Towns and cities don’t simply spring up randomly. There are many essential decisions that need to be made before settling on one place or another.</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">The most important thing that is needed, in any settlement, is access to fresh water (unless you’re writing about non-human characters that have no need for water. In which case, they will need access to their essential element for life.)</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Draw the water sources onto your map. Oceans, rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs. Any bodies of water that might exist in your world.</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Also think about where these water sources flow from, and where they flow to. Look at both natural sources of water, and man-made sources. How much has the natural landscape been controlled and changed for their needs? And, what about water sources that no longer exist? Or ones that have been forgotten, or lost underground?</span></p>
