<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">What food can your characters grow, or rear, or hunt? What needs to be imported? What can they afford to eat, and what is reserved only for the wealthy?</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Consider the seasons and the climate of your world. Consider the landscape. What food can they get when? Are they able to import out of season food? How do they store food? How do they harvest/catch/kill it, prepare it, and cook it? Whose responsibility is it?</span></p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">None of your worldbuilding elements live in isolation of the others. The issue of food is closely tied to trade, economics, gender roles. It’s also important in rites and rituals, religion, and festivals.</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">There might be beliefs and superstitions, as well as polite and rude behaviour.</span></p>

<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Make some notes about the importance of food in your world, and how it affects the lives of your characters. Also think about customs surrounding food, both every-day meals, and special occasions.</span></p>
