<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">As well as affecting your characters’ lives individually, magic also affects, and is affected by, society as a whole.</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Think about the different aspects of your society and the part that magic plays in them: education, industry, government, food and farming, trade, religion, economics, medicine, defence.</span></p>
<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"> </p>
<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Magic might be the very cornerstone of your society. It might form the basis of education, the laws may be based on magic, the religion, the technology. It might permeate every part of society.</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Or, perhaps it’s kept strictly separate. Perhaps they’re not allowed to teach magic in schools. Perhaps magic isn’t spoken of, and books on magic are removed from libraries. Are those books burnt, or are they hoarded away in private collections?</span></p>

<p class="P_Body_Text__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 1.00em; text-decoration: none !important; color: #000000;">Also think about how things have changed over the last few decades, or centuries. Maybe magic is being removed from society; laws changed, magic dropping off the school timetable, doctors abandoning magic in favour of modern medicine. Or maybe its influence is strengthening. For better or worse, think about the changing influence magic has had in your society.</span></p>

Remember this may be different in different places, or for different groups of people.</span></p>
