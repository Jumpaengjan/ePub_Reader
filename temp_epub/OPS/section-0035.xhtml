<p class="P_Normal__And__Justification__And__Spacing_After__And__Spacing_Before__And__Line_Spacing"><span style=" font-size: 1.00em;">Your world may have also seen big changes via a rise-up of the people. These don’t, necessarily, have to be violent uprisings. There may have been policy changes brought about diplomatically. Peacefully.</span></p>
