Mike has also contributed to several industry roundtables and white papers on digital identity and cyber fraud detection and prevention and has been a panelist and webinar presenter on these and related topics for ACAMS.</p>&#13;

<p id="f02-para-0009">Mike and his wife Nancy currently call Wexford, Ireland, their home.
