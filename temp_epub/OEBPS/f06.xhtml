<h2 id="head-2-218">About This Book</h2>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0004">You're here because you want to learn what it takes to be an SSCP. You know this will demand that you build a solid understanding of many different concepts, not only as theories but also as practical tasks you can <i>do</i> to help make information systems more secure. You know you'll need to master a number of key definitions and be able to apply those definitions to real-world situations—you'll need to operationalize those definitions and concepts by turning them into the step-by-step operations that <i>make</i> security become real.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0005">This book is your study guide. It guides you along your personal journey as you learn and master these ideas and technologies. It takes you on that journey concept by concept, starting with simple, fundamental ideas and growing them to the level of power and complexity <i>you</i> will need, on the job, as an SSCP. That is this book's focus, its purpose, and design.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0006">(ISC)<sup>2</sup> periodically updates the technical scope—the breadth and depth—of their various certifications to keep them more closely aligned with the needs of the security profession and to better focus them on the current tactics, techniques, and strategies that those professionals are using, day after day. This new edition of the Study Guide has also been updated to reflect and support readers like you as you work to strengthen your own knowledge of information systems security, and the proficiency of your skills with those concepts.</p>&#13;
<p>That means this book is also a valuable reference to have with you on the job, or as you continue to learn more about information security, information risk management, or any of a number of other related subject areas. You'll find it more than covers the topic domains that (ISC)<sup>2</sup> requires you to demonstrate competency in, should you want to earn your Systems Security Certified Practitioner credential.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-2-219">What Makes This the “Official” Study Guide for the SSCP?</h3>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0003"/>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0010">Good question! This book exists because (ISC)<sup>2</sup> wanted a book that would teach as well as guide and explain as well as capture the common knowledge about information assurance—keeping information systems safe and secure by protecting their information assets that all SSCPs should have at their mental fingertips. As creators of the SSCP program, (ISC)<sup>2</sup> defines that common body of knowledge, in continuous consultation with system security experts and practitioners from business, industry, government, and academia from around the world.</p>&#13;

<h2 id="head-2-220">What Is an SSCP?</h2>&#13;
<p>The SSCP is actually three things in one: a standard of excellence, a credential that attests to demonstrated excellence, and a <i>person</i> who has earned that credential. Perhaps instead of asking “what” is an SSCP, we should also ask <i>why</i>, <i>who</i>, and <i>how</i>:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0001">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0001"><i>SSCP as standard of excellence</i>. The International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)<sup>2</sup>, created this standard to reflect the continually evolving needs for people who can help all sorts of organizations around the world keep their information systems safe, secure, confidential, private, reliable, and trustworthy. Working with businesses, nonprofits, academic researchers, and the thought leaders of the cybersecurity and information assurance communities of practice, they developed the list of subject areas, or <i>domains</i>, that are the SSCP as a standard. That standard is set as the starting point for your professional journey as an information security specialist. Its focus is on hands-on technical knowledge combined with procedural and administrative awareness. The knowledge, skills, and abilities that make up the SSCP domains become the foundation for other, more advanced certifications (and hence standards).</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0002"><i>SSCP as a credential</i>. Earning an SSCP certification attests to the fact that you have solid working knowledge of the topic domains that are the SSCP. As a published standard of excellence, this certification or credential is portable—people in the information system business, or who know the needs of their own organizations for information security, recognize and respect this credential. People can easily consult (ISC)<sup>2</sup>'s published standards for the SSCP and understand what it means. It is a portable, stackable credential, meaning that it can clearly pave the way for you to take on job responsibilities that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxvii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxvii"/>need the knowledge and skills it attests to, and demonstrates you have the foundational knowledge to earn other credentials that can build on it.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0003"><i>SSCP as a goal or objective</i>. The SSCP as a standard answers the needs of hiring managers when they seek the right kind of people to help protect their organization's information, their information systems and processes, their IT infrastructure, and their ability to make informed decisions in reliable, timely ways. Training managers or functional department leaders in various organizations can design their own internal training and skills development programs around the SSCP, knowing that it is a reliable standard for information system security knowledge and experience. They can look at job descriptions or task designs and use the SSCP as a standard to identify whether the job and the SSCP are a good fit with each other or if other significant knowledge and skills will be needed by people filling that position.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0004"><i>SSCP as a person</i>. By choosing to earn an SSCP credential, you're declaring to yourself and to others that you're willing to hold yourself to a respected and recognized standard of excellence. You're willing to master what that standard asks of you, not only on the technical, physical, and administrative aspects of information security and assurance, but also on its legal and ethical requirements.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0012">The <i>Systems Security Certified Practitioner</i> is thus a person who does the job of systems security to a level of competency that meets or exceeds that standard and who has earned a credential as testament to their knowledge and skills. It is a foundational certification, based on the knowledge and skills that people should already have when they first start out as an information security professional.</p>&#13;
<p>Let's <i>operationalize</i> that set of words by showing them in action:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0002">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0005"><i>Systems</i>—Generally, a <i>system</i> is a collection or set of elements that interconnect and interact with each other to fulfill or achieve a larger purpose or objective. In this context, we mean information systems. <i>Information systems</i> are the collected sets of hardware, software, databases, and data sets; the communications, networking, and other technologies that connect all of those elements together into a cohesive, working whole; and the people who use them and depend on them to achieve their goals and objectives.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0006"><i>Security</i>—Again, generally speaking, security is the set of plans, procedures, and actions that keep something safe from harm, damage, or loss, through accident, acts of nature, or deliberate actions taken by people. Applying that to information systems, we see that <i>information systems security</i> is everything we need to do during design, implementation, operational use, and maintenance to keep all aspects of an information system protected against accidental or deliberate damage; it includes keeping its information free from unauthorized changes or viewing; and it keeps those systems up and running so that the information is there when people need it to get their jobs done.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0007"><i>Certified</i>—The person holding this credential (or certification) has earned the right to do so by means of having demonstrated their mastery of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are defined to be the subject area or domain of the certification. Specifically, an SSCP has passed the certification exam and demonstrated the required <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxviii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxviii"/>work experience in the field of information security, as specified by the SSCP subject area domains.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0008"><i>Practitioner</i>—A person whose professional or workplace duties, responsibilities, and tasks has them using the knowledge, skills, and abilities required by the standard to have earned the certification. There's a degree of <i>practice</i> in the definition of <i>practitioner</i>, of course; as a practitioner, you are continually <i>doing</i> the stuff of your profession, and in doing so you continue to <i>learn it better</i> as well as refine, polish, and enrich the ways in which you do those tasks and fulfill those responsibilities. Practitioners get better with practice! (After all, if you've been “practicing medicine” for 20 years, we expect you are a much better medical doctor now than you were when you started.)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0005"/>&#13;
<h3 id="head-3-289">What Can We Expect of Our SSCPs?</h3>&#13;
<p>The world of commerce, industry, and governance expects you, as an SSCP, to be a hands-on practitioner of information systems security, someone who continuously monitors information systems to safeguard against security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks while having the knowledge to apply security concepts, tools, and procedures to react to security incidents. As an SSCP, you demonstrate certain knowledge and skills, in areas such as:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0003">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0009">Information technology and cybersecurity theory and hands-on/technical practice</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0010">Cybersecurity policy, procedures, standards, and guidelines</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0011">Using simple coding or programming language techniques, in languages such as command-line interface, PowerShell, Java, HTML, CSS, Python, and C#</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0015">You'll also need more than just technical skills and knowledge. As an SSCP, you'll be working with people constantly as you assist them in securing their organization's information security needs. This takes adaptability on your part, plus strong interpersonal skills. You'll need to be a critical thinker and to make sound judgments; you'll have to communicate in person and in writing as you build and manage professional relationships within your organization and the larger information security community of practice. You'll build this social capital both through your problem-solving skills and by applying your emotional intelligence.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-2-221">Soft Skills: Very Strong Tickets to Success</h3>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0006"/>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0017">Employers, clients, and others you'll work with value your technical knowledge and skills, but they desperately need to be able to work with and communicate with you as you bring that knowledge and skills to bear on their problems. The irony of calling these skills “soft” is that for some of us, it can be very hard work to improve on them. Investing in improving these skills will more than pay off for you in terms of salary and opportunities.</p>&#13;

</aside>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0018"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxix" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxix"/>It's also natural to expect that as an SSCP, you will be continually learning about your craft. You'll keep current about the ways that threats evolve and stay informed about known vulnerabilities as they might be exploited against the systems under your care. You'll know how to apply analytical and research skills to dig deeper into what you're seeing in the way those systems are behaving, with an eye to identifying problems, recognizing that an information security incident might be under way, and responding to such incidents. This also means that you will periodically reflect on what you've been doing, how you've been doing it, and what you've been learning, and consider where improvement and growth are required to ensure continued effectiveness.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-290">Who Should Take the SSCP Certification Exam?</h3>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0019">The SSCP designation is designed for individuals who desire to learn hands-on, technical, cybersecurity fundamentals. While any individual who desires to practice cybersecurity can learn the material, there are certain requirements before sitting for the exam. SSCP candidates must have at least one year of cumulative work experience in one or more of the seven domains of the (ISC)<sup>2</sup> SSCP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK). A one-year prerequisite pathway will be granted for candidates who received an accredited university degree (bachelor's or master's) in a cybersecurity program. Candidates without the required experience can take and pass the SSCP exam to earn an Associate of (ISC)<sup>2</sup> designation and will have up to two years to gain the work experience needed for the SSCP.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-2-222">Certificate vs. Certification vs. “Being Certified”</h3>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0008"/>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0021">If you're new to formal certifications, these terms may seem interchangeable—but they are not!</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0022">A <i>certificate</i> is an official document or proof that displays or attests to your completion of a formal program, school, or training course. Earning a certificate may require passing a formal exam, hands-on practice, or just remaining in the course until the end. Certificate courses are designed to teach a skill and/or influence knowledge and understanding of a topic.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0023">A <i>certification</i> goes several steps further than a certificate. Typically, certifications require a minimum period of professional experience, which may include supervision by someone who also holds those same certifications.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0024">Certifications are established by professional organizations that serve a particular industry, and thus earning that certification means you've demonstrated what that industry needs. Certificates are defined and issued by the schools or training programs that teach them.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0025"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxx" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxx"/>Typically, certifications have requirements for ongoing learning, experience, and skills development; certificates usually do not.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0026">Finally, consider who awards you that credential. If it's the school or the training organization, it's a certificate. If it's that standards-setting body, it's a certification.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0027">As a result, you are entitled—you have earned the right—to put the official, accepted designation of that certification after your name, when used as a part of your professional correspondence, marketing, or other communications. John Doe, SSCP, or Jayne Smith, MD, are ways that these individuals rightfully declare their earned certifications.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0028">Academic programs increasingly offer sets of accredited university courses bundled as certificate programs; instead of completing 120 semester hours for a bachelor's degree, for example, a certificate program might require only 15 to 30 semester hours of study.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0029">Thus, we see that “being certified” means that you've met the standards required by the professional organization that defines and controls that certification as a process and as a standard; you've earned the right to declare yourself “certified” in the domain of that standard.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-291">The Global Need</h3>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0030">Cyberattacks have become tremendously big business worldwide. Attackers have proven that exploiting the security weaknesses of critical infrastructures, businesses across every industry, and government agency systems around the globe can bring the attackers tremendous profit. Critical infrastructure attacks have crippled hospital and public health systems, energy distribution, and water supply treatment systems. Misdirection, distortion, and malformed data attacks on news and information media as well as databases that support clinical trials of new medicines, or control the operation of manufacturing systems, provide further profit opportunities for those who carry out these attacks. The cybercrime business model does not just begin and end with the attacker, however; it includes those who perform targeting intelligence-gathering operations, resell stolen data and intellectual property, and a hundred other logistics and support tasks that sophisticated cyber attackers benefit from.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0031">Governments cannot protect all of the information systems that our modern digital age depends upon—nearly all of them are owned and operated by private businesses. Each of these owner-operators has the responsibility and the opportunity to do a far, far better job of securing their systems to protect the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of their data, their organizations, and their people.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0032">National and international standards do exist to help guide the information security profession in accomplishing this task. From a global perspective, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) have jointly issued their own family of standards designed to help private and public <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxi" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxxi"/>organizations worldwide attain minimum acceptable standards in achieving information security, information assurance, and cybersecurity. The ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provides best-practice recommendations on information security management and the management of information risks through information security controls, within the context of an overall information security management system (ISMS). ISO/IEC 27001 is the best-known standard in the family providing requirements for an ISMS. The European Union has issued a series of regulations and policy documents that help refine and implement these ISO/IEC standards.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0033">In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the lead in defining standards-based frameworks and approaches for identifying, managing, and controlling risks to information systems and infrastructures. As a part of this effort, NIST established the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE). This partnership between government, academia, and the private sector works to continually define the standards and best practices that cybersecurity professional educators and trainers need to fulfill to produce a qualified cybersecurity workforce. The US Department of Defense (DoD) has continued its efforts to professionalize its workforce (both the uniformed and civilian members) and, in a series of regulations and directives, has defined its baseline set of approved certifications in various fields. One of these, DoD Directive 8140, defines the minimum acceptable certifications someone must demonstrate to hold jobs in the information assurance technical, managerial, and systems architecture job series. DoD 8140 also defines the certifications necessary to hold jobs as a cybersecurity service provider at various levels.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0034">(ISC)<sup>2</sup> plays a part in helping all of these standards bodies and regulatory agencies assess the current needs of the information security community of practitioners and works to update its set of certifications to support these national, international, and global needs. As a result, the SSCP certification is recognized around the world.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-292">The SSCP and Your Professional Growth Path</h3>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0035">Possibly one of the best ways to see your SSCP in the context of your professional growth and development can be seen at the CyberSeek website. CyberSeek is a partnership sponsored by NIST that brings together the current state of the job market in cybersecurity, information security, and information risk management. It combines data on job market demand for such skills, current average salaries, and even insight on the numbers of professionals holding various certifications. The real gem, however, for the new cybersecurity or information security pro is its Career Mapping tool. See this at <code><a href="http://www.cyberseek.org">www.cyberseek.org</a></code> and use it to help navigate the options to consider and the opportunities that an earned “SSCP” after your name might open up. It's true that CyberSeek focuses on the US job market and job descriptions as it maps those against different certifications; but a few minute's perusal of its data, when compared with the job market in any other country, will show very similar job titles and functions. Let's face it: a cybersecurity intelligence analyst, or a network security administrator, has much the same job functions to perform no matter where in the world their employer happens to be located.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxxii"/>As an international, nonprofit membership association with more than 160,000 members, (ISC)<sup>2</sup> has worked since its inception in 1989 to serve the needs for standardization and certification in cybersecurity workplaces around the world. Since then, (ISC)<sup>2</sup>'s founders and members have been shaping the information security profession and have developed the following information security certifications:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0004">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0012"><i>Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)</i>: The CISSP is an experienced professional who holds the most globally recognized standard of achievement in the industry; it was the first information security credential to meet the strict conditions of ISO/IEC Standard 17024. The CISSP certification has three concentrations:&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0005">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0013"><i>Certified Information Systems Security Professional: Information Systems Security Architecture Professional (CISSP-ISSAP)</i>: The CISSP-ISSAP is a chief security architect, analyst, or other professional who designs, builds, and oversees the implementation of network and computer security for an organization. The CISSP-ISSAP may work as an independent consultant or other professional who provides operational guidance and direction to support business strategies.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0014"><i>Certified Information Systems Security Professional: Information Systems Security Engineering Professional (CISSP-ISSEP)</i>: The CISSP-ISSEP can effectively incorporate security into all facets of business operations.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0015"><i>Certified Information Systems Security Professional: Information Systems Security Management Professional (CISSP-ISSMP)</i>: The CISSP-ISSMP is a cybersecurity manager who demonstrates deep management and leadership skills and excels at establishing, presenting, and governing information security programs.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0016"><i>Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP)</i>: The SSCP is a high-value practitioner who demonstrates technical skills in implementing, monitoring, and administering IT infrastructure using information security policies and procedures. The SSCP's commitment to continuous learning and practice ensures consistent information assurance.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0017"><i>Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)</i>: The CCSP is a globally recognized professional who demonstrates expertise and implements the highest standards in cloud security. The certification was co-created by (ISC)<sup>2</sup> and Cloud Security Alliance—the leading stewards for information security and cloud computing security.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0018"><i>Certified Authorization Professional (CAP)</i>: The CAP is a leader in information security and aligns information systems with the risk management framework (RMF). The CAP certification covers the RMF at an extensive level, and it's the only certification under the DoD 8570/DoD 8140 Approved Baseline Certifications that aligns to each of the RMF steps.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0019"><i>Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP)</i>: The CSSLP is an internationally recognized professional with the ability to incorporate security practices—authentication, authorization, and auditing—into each phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0020"><i>HealthCare Information Security and Privacy Practitioner (HCISPP)</i>: The HCISSP is a skilled practitioner who combines information security with healthcare security and privacy best practices and techniques.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0038"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxiii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxxiii"/>Each of these certifications has its own requirements for documented full-time experience in its requisite topic areas.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0039">Newcomers to information security who have not yet had supervised work experience in the topic areas can take and pass the SSCP exam and then become recognized as Associates of (ISC)<sup>2</sup>. Associates then have two years to attain the required experience to become full members of (ISC)<sup>2</sup>.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-293">The SSCP Seven Domains</h3>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0040">(ISC)<sup>2</sup> is committed to helping members learn, grow, and thrive. The Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) is the comprehensive framework that helps it fulfill this commitment. The CBK includes all the relevant subjects a security professional should be familiar with, including skills, techniques, and best practices. (ISC)<sup>2</sup> uses the various domains of the CBK to test a certificate candidate's levels of expertise in the most critical aspects of information security. You can see this framework in the SSCP Exam Outline here:</p>&#13;

<h2 id="head-2-223">Using This Book</h2>&#13;
<p>This book is structured to take you on your learning journey through all seven subject area domains that the SSCP requires. It does this one building block at a time, starting with the fundamentals involved in a particular topic or subject and building on those to guide you toward the degree of knowledge you'll need as an SSCP. This journey does not assume you already have broad or deep knowledge or experience in any one domain—or, for that matter, in information security at all. Instead, it starts with broad concepts that are then broken down into successively finer-grain details, which are then placed into an operational context. This journey is structured in four major parts:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0014">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0063"><a href="p01.xhtml">Part 1</a> provides a solid foundation of how organizations use information to drive decision making, and the role of information systems and information technologies in making that information available, reliable, and useful. It then looks to the fundamental concepts of information security and assurance, using operational definitions and examples to help you apply these concepts to real-world situations you may find around you today:&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0015">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0064">Business and the private sector speak their own language, and organize, direct, manage, and lead their people in different ways than do governments or military services. If you haven't had experience in the private sector or have no business background, start with <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.&#13;

<h3 id="head-2-224">Using the Language of Business</h3>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0013"/>&#13;
<p><a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> has been extensively revised in this edition to place security fundamental concepts into the context of business logic and organizational management processes. Even if you've had private sector work experience, you'll find <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a> will strengthen your understanding of <i>why</i> business finds information security and assurance so important. With that as foundation, you can go on and learn <i>how</i> to make that security happen.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0066"><a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> provides a deep look at the fundamentals of information security and assurance. It also establishes the ethical and operational framework that forms the foundation of the rest of book.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0067"><a href="p02.xhtml">Part 2</a> takes you deep into the practice of information risk management as part of building and maintaining a proactive information systems defensive posture:&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0017">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0068"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> defines the basic concepts of risk management and risk mitigation and familiarizes you with the processes all organizations can use to understand risks, characterize their impact on organizational objectives, and prioritize how to deal with information risks specifically.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0069"><a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> dives into risk mitigation. Here's where we make decisions about specific risks (or, rather, about the vulnerabilities we've discovered that could lead to such a risk becoming reality). We'll look at choices you can make, or advise your company's management to make, and how you can estimate the value of your mitigation choices as compared to the possible impacts if nothing is done.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0070"><a href="p03.xhtml">Part 3</a> gets down into the technologies of information security; we'll start each major subject area in <a href="p03.xhtml">Part 3</a> first by reviewing the fundamentals of various information systems technologies and how they are used, and then look to their vulnerabilities and what choices we might have to help mitigate their associated risks. One important point that is emphasized throughout Part 3 is the need to own and manage the baseline architectures of our information systems—for without effective management of our systems, we have little hope of being able to keep them secure, much less operating correctly!&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0018">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0071"><a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> is all about communications as a people-to-people and systems-to-systems set of processes and <i>protocols</i>. Two <i>protocol stacks</i>—the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-layer reference model and the Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)—will become your highway to understanding and appreciating the different perspectives you'll need as you seek to secure networks and systems.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0072"><a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a> considers identity management and access control, which are two sides of the same process: how do we know that users or processes asking to use our systems and our information are who they claim they are, and how do we control, limit, or deny their access to or use of any of our information, our systems, our knowledge, or our people?</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0073"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxvii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxxvii"/><a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> demystifies cryptography and cryptographic systems, with special emphasis on the use of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms as part of our digital certificates, signatures, and public infrastructure for security. It also explores the management of cryptologic systems and assets.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0074"><a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> considers the security aspects of computing and communications hardware, and the systems software, utilities, firmware, and connections that bring that all together.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0075"><a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a> continues on the foundation laid in <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a> by investigating how we secure applications software, data, and endpoint devices. It also looks at the specific issues involved when organizations migrate their information systems to the cloud (or have developed them in the cloud from the beginning).</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0076"><a href="p04.xhtml">Part 4</a> shifts the emphasis back onto the real driving, integrative force that we need to apply to our information security problems: the people power inherent in our workforce, their managers and leaders, and even our customers, clients, and those we partner with or share federated systems with:&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0019">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0077"><a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> takes us through the information security incident response process, from planning and preparation through the real-time challenges of detection, identification, and response. It then takes us through the post-response tasks and shows how attention to these can increase our organization's chances of never having to cope with making the same mistakes twice by learning from the experiences of an incident response while they're still fresh in our response team members' minds.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0078"><a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> addresses business continuity and disaster recovery, which are both the overriding purpose of information security and assurance and the worst-case scenario for why we need to plan and prepare if we want our organization to survive a major incident and carry on with business as usual.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0079"><a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a> takes a look back across all chapters and then goes further into some of the more challenging concepts and ideas, applying them to different settings. It then highlights important issues and trends that you as an SSCP may have to deal with in the very near future. It also offers some last-minute practical advice on getting ready to take your SSCP exam and ideas for what you can do after that.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0065">As you look at the chapters and the domains, you should quickly see that some domains fit neatly into a chapter all by themselves; other domains share the limelight with each other in the particular chapters that address their subject areas. You'll also see that some chapters focus on building foundational knowledge and skills; others build applied problem-solving skills and approaches; and some provide a holistic, integrated treatment spanning CBK domains. This is intentional—the design of this book takes you on a journey of learning and mastery of those seven CBK domains.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0066">Risk identification, monitoring, and analysis <i>as a domain</i> is a fundamental element of two chapters (<a href="c03.xhtml">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="c04.xhtml">4</a>) almost by itself. This important topic deserves this level of attention; you might even say that the very reason we <i>do</i> information security at all is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxviii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxxviii"/>because we're trying to manage and mitigate risks to our information! Similarly, we see that <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, which focuses on the people power aspects of achieving business continuity in the face of information security incidents and disasters, must make significant use of the <i>domains</i> of access control, security operations and administration, and risk identification, monitoring, and analysis. Finally, the growing emphasis in the marketplace on data security, cloud security, endpoint security, and software lifecycle security dictates that we first build a strong foundation on hardware and systems security (<a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>), on which we build our knowledge and skills for applications, data, cloud, and mobile endpoint security.</p>&#13;

<h2 id="head-2-225">Major Changes in This Edition</h2>&#13;
<p>In putting together both the 2021 SSCP Exam Outline and its official SSCP training materials, (ISC)<sup>2</sup> has introduced new topics and put greater emphasis on some previously existing ones. These changes are reflected in this edition of the Study Guide as well. Major changes include the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0020">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0080"><b>CIANA+PS:</b> Expanding the “CIA Triad” (of confidentiality, integrity, and availability) to CIANA+PS. Adding nonrepudiation, authenticity, privacy, and safety to this mnemonic throughout the course and this study guide reflects the elevated sense of risk that many businesses, governments, consumers, and citizens alike are feeling, as cyberattacks against energy systems, medical care, food processing, and financial systems continue to escalate.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0081"><b>Operational technology (OT):</b> Digital control of our physical environment is everywhere! From the Internet of Things to manufacturing and industrial process control, and from implanted medical devices to self-driving vehicles and drones, the bridge between the IT systems that plan these operations and the OT systems that make physical things happen affects our workplaces, our homes, and our lives. The data and control flows between IT and OT systems, and the threats that can cross those thresholds, have become lucrative targets to cyberattackers.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0082"><b>Entities and identities, for human and nonhuman users alike:</b> Whether it's smartphones or OT systems elements, many organizations have already expanded their user base to include real and virtual entities alike. Just-in-time identity, third-party identity services (such as using your Google or Facebook credentials to sign on to another website), and connection management also get a deeper look.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0083"><b>Compliance: a pathway to greater security, whether required or not:</b> ISO, NIST, and other information security–related standards and compliance frameworks represent a valuable knowledge bank—one that any organization that does <i>not</i> have to achieve compliance can learn from.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0084"><b>Individuals and smaller organizations:</b> Many of the basic security hygiene measures, as well as cutting-edge security technologies and approaches can and must be applied to the individual, small or home office (SOHO), and small to medium business (SMB).</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0085"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxix" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xxxix"/><b>Information classification and categorization:</b> Clarifying these two important steps in the information risk management and mitigation process is shown to be straightforward and necessary—even beyond those involved with government and military systems.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0086"><b>Analytics for security—more than log management:</b> The business model for doing security—for managing risk by preventing, detecting, and responding to security incidents—has pivoted in recent years. Simply put, the data deluge from all of those devices and sensors and agents is <i>good</i> news—if we use state-of-the-practice tools and services to take a big-picture view of it. And since these tools are often available free or at very low cost for individual, SOHO, or SMB use, it's time we start applying them.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0087"><b>Cryptographic asset management</b>: Digital certificates have become the mainstay of many online operations today; these, too, are valuable and important information assets that must be protected.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0088"><b>Vulnerability management:</b> Expanded coverage of this important part of the SSCP's responsibilities now includes MITRE's ATT&amp;CK Framework, as part of dealing with the risks posed by advanced persistent threats.</li>&#13;

<h2 id="head-2-227">Earning Your Certification</h2>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0074">Earning your SSCP requires that you take and pass the SSCP exam, of course; it also requires that you have at least one year of full-time work experience, in at least one of the seven domains of knowledge of the SSCP. A one-year prerequisite waiver will be granted by (ISC)<sup>2</sup> if you have earned a degree (bachelors or masters) in a cybersecurity program. The website <code><a href="https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/SSCP/Prerequisite-Pathway">https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/SSCP/Prerequisite-Pathway</a></code> explains this and should be your guide. Note the requirements to be able to document your work experience.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0075">No matter where you are on that pathway right now, put this book to work! Use it as a ready reference, as a roadmap, and as a learning tool. Let it help you broaden and deepen your knowledge base, while you sharpen your skills on the job or in your classes—or both!</p>&#13;

<p>The key to this or any personal and professional development you want to achieve is to first set your goals. SMART goals can help you plan and achieve most anything you set your body, mind, heart, and spirit to:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0021">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0089"><i>Specific</i>—What is it, <i>exactly</i>, that you want to achieve?</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0090"><i>Measurable</i>—How will you know that you've achieved that specific goal?</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0091"><i>Achievable</i>—Is it really within your power and ability to achieve it? Or do you need to first build other strengths, develop other talents, or align other resources to help you take this goal on?</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0092"><i>Realistic</i>—Can you actually do this? Are there practical ways to go about accomplishing this goal?</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0093"><i>Timely</i>—When, <i>exactly</i>, do you want or need to accomplish this goal by?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0077">Having set SMART goals, set a plan; lay out the tasks you'll need to accomplish, and break those down, week by week, perhaps even day by day, to get to the goals of taking and passing the exam and having the prerequisite experience or earned degree.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0078">Start by thoroughly reading, and rereading, this study guide. Work through its review questions, not only to focus on why the <i>right</i> answers are in fact correct, but to identify and understand what's wrong with the <i>wrong</i> answers. Work through the case studies, and let them suggest other real-world issues to you as you do.</p>&#13;
<p>Other options to consider include the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0022">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0094">Volunteer, at work, at school, or in your local community, to work with others on information security–related projects or tasks.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0095">Find a study buddy.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0096">Enlist the help and guidance of a mentor.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0097">Enroll in formal training courses for the SSCP, either face to face, virtual live online, or in other modes that suit you.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0098">Take college courses that prepare you for the SSCP or that help you master some or all of its domains of knowledge.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0099">Use other learning resources, such as videos and IT and security blog sites.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0080">If you're already working (even part-time) in an IT-related job, consider talking with your supervisor about your ambition to earn your SSCP; you might find a wealth of practical advice and assistance right there at work!</p>&#13;

<h3 id="head-3-295">The SSCP Exam</h3>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0081">The SSCP exam is a computer-based examination, which you must take at an (ISC)<sup>2</sup> approved testing facility. Pearson VUE is (ISC)<sup>2</sup>'s official and exclusive global testing partner, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xliii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xliii"/>but be advised: not all Pearson VUE testing locations meet the special test security requirements that (ISC)<sup>2</sup> imposes on test-takers and proctors alike. Start by reviewing the testing terms and conditions here: <code><a href="https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam">https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam</a></code>.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0082">Register early at <code><a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/isc2">https://home.pearsonvue.com/isc2</a></code>, and select the SSCP as the certification exam you're pursuing. Check the availability of testing centers at or near locations that best suit your needs. Note that different testing centers have different schedule options, with some being more available on the weekends while others might be closed.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0083">You don't have to pay at this step—you pay for your exam when you're ready to schedule the exam (and you're ready to schedule the exam once you know when you'll be ready to take and pass it!).</p>&#13;
<p>A great way to learn more about the exam process is to take a “test-drive,” using the exam demo and tutorial about the exam experience. You can find this on the Pearson VUE website, <code><a href="https://www.pearsonvue.com/athena/athena.asp">https://www.pearsonvue.com/athena/athena.asp</a></code>.</p>&#13;

<p id="f05-para-0085">Armed with driving or public transport directions and a map, find your way from home (or where you'll be coming to the test from) to the testing site of your choice. Check out how long that trip takes at the time of day you want to take the test—or at the times of day that center has a testing slot available! (Take this “test-drive” a few days in advance.)</p>&#13;

<section><span id="f05-sec-0024"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-110">The Exam Structure and Format</h4>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0094">During the SSCP exam, you will focus on recalling, recognizing, and indicating your understanding of the information and ideas presented in this study guide. The SSCP exam is <i>proctored</i>, which means you will be supervised by a neutral person (a proctor) at all times while taking the test. The exam is pass/fail.</p>&#13;
<p>There are 125 multiple-choice questions on the exam. Of that number, only 100 are graded, whereas the remaining 25 are evaluated by exam developers and used to inform future exams. You will not know which of the 100 questions will be graded, so be sure to answer all exam questions to the best of your ability. The questions are written to check that you remember, understand, and can apply what you've learned in the seven knowledge domains that make up the SSCP, and they are covered by this study guide. Here are some thoughts to keep in mind about these questions and the exam process itself:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0023">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0100">Each multiple-choice question will list four possible answers.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0101">There are no true or false questions.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0102">Expect scenario-based questions that describe a situation and then ask that you use the situation to select the correct multiple-choice answer.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0103">All acronyms are spelled out, such as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0104">Many questions will ask for the <i>most</i> or <i>least</i> correct answer.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0105">Some questions will contain logical operators, such as <i>not</i>, <i>always</i>, <i>test</i>, <i>true</i>, or <i>false</i>.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0096">You are not penalized for wrong answers, so be sure to answer every question. You will need a score of 700 out of 1000 points to pass the exam. The questions are weighted. This means you may be required to have more or fewer than 70 questions answered correctly to pass the exam.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0097"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xlv" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xlv"/>One of the benefits to candidates taking an examination via computer-based training (CBT) is that most candidates receive their scores immediately upon completing their examination. In some cases, however, to ensure it is providing accurate and valid test results to candidates, (ISC)<sup>2</sup> must conduct periodic psychometric analyses of a group of candidates' responses before it releases their exam results. For the small number of candidates affected by this process, the candidates will receive their results within four to six weeks after taking the exam. (ISC)<sup>2</sup> apologizes in advance for this inconvenience to those candidates who will not receive their pass/fail status at the test centers, but this is an important part of (ISC)<sup>2</sup>'s quality assurance process to protect the integrity of the credentials. Candidates who are impacted by this process will be informed when they complete their tests.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0025"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-111">Reasonable Accommodations</h4>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0098">If you require reasonable and appropriate accommodations for exams, you can request special accommodations through (ISC)<sup>2</sup>. Once these are approved, be sure to coordinate with your chosen test center to ensure that they can meet your needs. <i>Work through this process early</i>. The on-site test administrator will not have the power to grant you an accommodation at the time of your exam if it has not been approved in advance.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0099">(ISC)<sup>2</sup> provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations for its exams for people who have demonstrated a need for test accommodations. If you want to request an accommodation, please visit <code><a href="http://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam">www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam</a></code> and click Requesting Special Accommodations for information on requesting an accommodation.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0100">Test accommodations are individualized and considered on a case-by-case basis. Once an accommodation is approved by (ISC)<sup>2</sup>, they will send it to Pearson VUE Accommodations. Please allow two to three business days for Pearson VUE to get this information. Then, call Pearson VUE at 800-466-0450 so that you can schedule your exam. Please don't start by scheduling through Pearson VUE's website or through their main registration phone line. Contact (ISC)<sup>2</sup> first.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0101">Please note that the purpose of test accommodations is to provide examinees with full access to the test. However, they are not a guarantee of improved performance or test completion.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0026"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-112">On the Day of the Exam</h4>&#13;
<p>Plan to arrive at your test center at least 30 minutes before your exam start time. To check in, you'll need to:</p>&#13;
<ul class="square" id="f05-list-0024">&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0106">Show two valid, unexpired forms of personal ID (examples include government-issued IDs such as a driver's license, passport, etc.). Both must have your signature, and one of the two must have your photo. For more information about acceptable IDs, please visit <code><a href="https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam">https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam</a></code>, and click What You Need to Bring to the Test Center for more information.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0107">Provide your signature.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0108">Submit to a palm vein scan (unless it's prohibited by law).</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0109"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xlvi" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="xlvi"/>Have your photo taken. Hats, scarves, and coats may not be worn for your photo. You also can't wear these items in the test room.</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-li-0110">Leave your personal belongings outside the testing room. You'll have access to secure storage. Storage space is small, so plan ahead. Pearson VUE test centers do not assume responsibility for your personal belongings.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0103">The test administrator (TA) will give you a short orientation. If you have already arranged for special accommodations for your testing and (ISC)<sup>2</sup> and Pearson VUE have approved these, be sure to go over them with the TA. Then, the TA will escort you to a computer terminal. Upon concluding the exam, click the Finish or Submit button.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section><span id="f05-sec-0027"/>&#13;
<h4 id="head-4-113">After the Exam</h4>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0104">The proctor will escort you out of the room. You'll receive a printed copy of your preliminary examination report by the front-desk attendant. The report will congratulate you for passing the exam or, should you fail, list the domains you need to study again from weakest to strongest.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0105">Upon successfully passing the SSCP exam, you are not yet certified until (ISC)<sup>2</sup> approves it. You must be endorsed by another (ISC)<sup>2</sup>-certified professional before the credential can be awarded. The New Endorsement Application is located here: <code><a href="https://apps.isc2.org/Endorsement/#/Home">https://apps.isc2.org/Endorsement/#/Home</a></code>.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0106">An endorser can be anyone who is an active (ISC)<sup>2</sup> credential holder and can attest to your assertions regarding professional experience and education (if applicable) and that you are in good standing within the cybersecurity industry.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0107">If you do not know an (ISC)<sup>2</sup>-certified professional, you may request (ISC)<sup>2</sup> to endorse your application.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0108">Although you can start and save a draft application, you must pass the exam for the selected certification before you can submit your application for endorsement.</p>&#13;
<p id="f05-para-0109">If you do not yet possess the education and/or experience required for the certification, you can request to be an Associate of (ISC)<sup>2</sup>, which requires only that you pass the credential exam.</p>&#13;

<li id="f05-ex-0001">Which statement about business continuity planning and information security is most correct?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>Plans are useful only because they start the development of detailed procedures and processes, and thus, there is no need to maintain or improve such plans.</li>&#13;
<li>Planning is more important than the plans it produces.</li>&#13;
<li>Plans represent significant investments and decisions and thus should be updated only when significant changes to objectives or circumstances dictate.</li>&#13;
<li>Planning should continuously bring plans and procedures in tune with ongoing operational reality.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0002">Which of the following statements about social engineering attacks is incorrect?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>Most targeted individuals don't see the harm in responding to or in answering simple questions posed by the attacker.</li>&#13;
<li>Most people believe they are too smart to fall for such obvious ploys, but they do anyway.</li>&#13;
<li>Most targeted individuals and organizations have effective tools and procedures to filter out phishing and related scams, so they are now better protected from such attacks.</li>&#13;
<li>Most people want to be trusting and helpful.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0003">In general, what differentiates phishing from whaling attacks?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>Phishing attacks tend to be used to gain access to systems via malware payloads or by getting recipients to disclose information, whereas whaling attacks try to get responsible managers to authorize payments to the attacker's accounts.</li>&#13;
<li>Phishing attacks are focused on businesses; whaling attacks are focused on high-worth individuals.</li>&#13;
<li>Whaling attacks tend to offer something that ought to sound “too good to be true,” whereas phishing attacks masquerade as routine business activities such as package delivery confirmations.</li>&#13;
<li>Whaling attacks send out huge numbers of emails attempting to lure targeted individuals into responding or following a link; phishing attacks use telephones or other means of making personal contact with a selected target.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0004">You're the only IT person at a small tool and die machine shop, which uses a LAN and cloud-hosted platforms to run the business on. The previous IT person had told your boss not to worry about the business being the target of a cyberattack. Which statement best lets you explain the real risks the company might face?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>Since we don't handle consumer-level payment cards and we really don't have any proprietary information, we probably don't have to worry about being a target.</li>&#13;

<li>International standards and agreements specify that personally identifiable information (PII) and information about an individual's healthcare, education, work, or credit history must be protected from unauthorized use or disclosure.</li>&#13;
<li>It's up to the organization that gathers, produces, uses, or disposes of such private data to determine what protection, if any, is needed.</li>&#13;
<li>Storing backup or archive copies of privacy-related information in a datacenter in another country, without doing any processing there, does not subject you to that country's data protection laws.</li>&#13;
<li>Sometimes it seems cheaper to run the risk of fines or loss of business from a data breach involving privacy-related data than to implement proper data protection to prevent such a loss. While this might make financial sense, it is not legal or ethical to do so.</li>&#13;

<li>Subnetting applies only to IPv4 networks, unless you are using classless interdomain routing.</li>&#13;
<li>Both IPv4 and IPv6 provide for subnetting, but the much larger IPv6 address field makes this a lot simpler to design and manage.</li>&#13;
<li>Subnetting in IPv4 involves the CIDR protocol, which runs at Layer 3; in IPv6, this protocol, and hence subnetting, is not used.</li>&#13;
<li>Because the subnet mask field is so much larger in IPv6, it is easier to subnet in this newer protocol stack than in IPv4.</li>&#13;

<li id="f05-ex-0030">What important role does systems monitoring perform in support of incident management?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>They are not related; monitoring is a routine task that uses trend analysis and data analytics to determine whether past systems behavior and use has been within expected bounds.</li>&#13;
<li>Essential; by bringing together alert and alarm indicators from systems and their associated security controls and countermeasures, monitoring is the watchdog capability that activates incident response capabilities and plans.</li>&#13;
<li>Incident response includes its own monitoring and alarms capabilities, so systems monitoring provides a good backup or alternate path to determining whether an incident is occurring.</li>&#13;
<li>Ongoing, continuous monitoring is used to adjust or fine-tune alarm threshold settings so that false alarm rates can be better managed.</li>&#13;

<li>Transfer this risk to insurers or other parties.</li>&#13;
<li>Ensure that systems elements around the gap provide sufficient detection and reporting capabilities so that an event of interest occurring in the gap cannot spread without being detected.</li>&#13;
<li>Ensure that other systems elements can either detect or report when an event of interest is happening within the gap.</li>&#13;
<li>You can't, as by definition the gap is where you have no appreciable security coverage, and this includes having no monitoring or detection capabilities.</li>&#13;

<li>Recognize that government agencies have the responsibility to contain, control, or prevent this risk, which your taxes pay them to do.</li>&#13;
<li>Pay insurance premiums for a policy that provides for payment of claims and liabilities in the event the risk does occur.</li>&#13;

<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>It should provide most if not all of the vulnerability information you need to implement risk mitigation.</li>&#13;
<li>Since hackers use CVE data to aid in planning their attacks, this should be the first place you look for insight as you do emergency hardening of your IT systems. Once these obvious vulnerabilities have been mitigated, a more complete vulnerability assessment should be done.</li>&#13;
<li>It's a great source of information for known systems elements and known vulnerabilities associated with them, but it does nothing for vulnerabilities that haven't been reported yet or for company-developed IT elements.</li>&#13;
<li>Since the vast majority of systems in use are based on Windows, if your business does not use Windows platforms you can probably avoid the expense of investigating CVE for vulnerability information.</li>&#13;

<li>Senior leaders and managers in many businesses appreciate active, thoughtful, forward-looking approaches, and you will find it easier to gain their support.</li>&#13;
<li>Proactive information security systems allow your security specialists to take real-time control of all systems elements and bring all information about events of interest into one common operational picture. This greatly enhances your ability to detect, characterize, and contain incidents.</li>&#13;
<li>Being proactive means that you use the best knowledge you have today, including lessons learned from other organizations' experience with information risk, and you plan ahead to use these lessons to deal with these risks then, rather than wait for them to occur and then investigate how to respond to them.</li>&#13;

<li>This looks like an error in estimation or assessment and should be further investigated.</li>&#13;

<li id="f05-ex-0042">Which statement is incorrect as to how you should use RTO, MAO, and RPO in planning information risk management activities?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>Return to operations (RTO) is the desired time to get all business processes back into operation, whether on backup or workaround systems or on production systems brought back to normal. The recovery priority objective (RPO) sets priorities for which systems to bring up first or which business processes to get back into operation before others (of lower priority).</li>&#13;
<li>Recovery point objective (RPO) establishes the maximum amount of data that is lost due to a risk event. This could be in numbers of transactions or in units of time and indicates the amount of rework of information that is acceptable to get systems back into normal operation.</li>&#13;
<li>Recovery time objective (RTO) must be less than or equal to the maximum acceptable outage. MAO sets a maximum downtime (outage time) before mission impact becomes unacceptable; RTO can be used to emphasize faster-than-MAO restoration.</li>&#13;
<li>Maximum acceptable outage (MAO) relates to the mission or business objectives; if multiple systems support those objectives, then all of their recovery time objectives (RTOs) must be less than or equal to the MAO.</li>&#13;

<li id="f05-ex-0045">As an SSCP, you work at the headquarters of a retail sales company that has many stores around the country. Its training department has prepared different training materials and operations manuals for in-store sales, warehouse staff, and other team members to use in their jobs. Almost all of these describe procedures that people do as they work with each other or with customers. From an information security standpoint, which of the following statements is correct?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>Since these all describe people-to-people interactions and processes, they are not implemented by the IT department, so they're not something that information security is concerned with.</li>&#13;
<li>Most of their content is probably common practice in business and retail sales and so would not be trade secrets, company proprietary, or private to the company.</li>&#13;
<li>Although these processes are not implemented in IT systems, the documents and videos themselves are hosted in company-provided IT systems, so information security requirements apply.</li>&#13;
<li>If the company has decided that the content of these training materials is proprietary or company confidential, then their confidentiality must be protected. They must also be protected from tampering or unauthorized changes and be available to staff in the stores to use when they need them if the company is to do business successfully. Therefore, information security applies.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0046">We often hear people talk about the need for information systems to be safe and reliable. Is this the same as saying that they need to be secure?&#13;
<ol class="upper-alpha">&#13;
<li>No, because reliability has to do with failures of equipment, errors in software design or use, or bad data used as input, whereas security is focused on keeping the systems and their data safe from intrusion or unwanted change.</li>&#13;
<li>Yes, because the objective of information security is to increase our confidence that we can make sound and prudent decisions based on what those information systems are telling us and, in doing so, cause no harm.</li>&#13;
<li>Yes, because all information and information systems are built by humans, and humans make mistakes, so we need strong safety rules and procedures to keep from causing harm.</li>&#13;
<li>No, but they have ideas in common. For example, data integrity can lead to unsafe operation, but information security by itself cannot identify possible safety consequences.</li>&#13;

<li>Confidential information is information that must be kept private, so they really have similar meanings.</li>&#13;
<li>Privacy laws allow criminals to hide their actions and intentions from society, but confidentiality allows for the government to protect defense-related information from being leaked to our enemies.</li>&#13;

<ol>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0051">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. Planning should be an ongoing, continuous, and iterative process; plans are thus continually tested against reality so that changes to plans and procedures stay harmonized. Thus, option D is most correct. Option C, unfortunately, is a commonly held view and can lead to work being done to obsolete ideas or to assumptions long since proven to be incorrect by reality. Option B is good but not as correct and complete as option D. Option A is incorrect; effective plans define and prioritize objectives, lay out major tasks and processes, assign resources to achieve them, and define success criteria for each; plans should be manageable and measurable.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0052">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">C. Options A, B, and D all demonstrate the hallmarks of social engineering attacks—they work (and have worked for thousands of years) because people are generally trusting, open, and willing to engage with strangers. Option C, the correct choice, is unfortunately not true; tools may help filter out some email-based social engineering attacks, but few organizations have truly been able to operate with a “loose lips sink ships” approach and deal openly with customers, clients, and many other outside stakeholders.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0053">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. Option A is correct; phishing tends to seek information, and whaling (and spear phishing) seeks action, typically the release of funds to the attacker. Option B is incorrect; whaling is primarily aimed at senior business leaders, whereas phishing can be aimed at anybody, anywhere, if the attacker perceives there is something worthwhile to learn in doing so. Option C has these reversed; whaling attacks depend on credibility of the business transaction they request. Option D is incorrect, since it reverses key characteristics of whaling and phishing.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0054">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. While option A may be true, it is naïve and incorrect; the air conditioning company that serviced Target stores didn't handle retail (credit card) sales either, yet attackers found it to be an ideal entry into Target's payment processing systems. Option C is also incorrect; your cloud hosts will protect their systems, and their platforms, from malware attacks from your connections, but attackers who spoof bogus, privileged accounts into your systems can still destroy your business's presence in those cloud systems. Option B is incorrect; without doing a detailed vulnerability assessment of that architecture, you are at risk making this assumption. Option D offers the boss a sensible first step.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0055">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. Option A by itself won't do what is needed; at a minimum, option D, and its implementation of rigorous access control and identity management, is necessary to protect network storage resources from being corrupted, tampered with, and so forth. The others are all valuable parts of a data governance and data security/data protection plan.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0056">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A, B. The key determiner of whether user-defined and user-maintained “stuff” is shadow IT is the amount of business logic that it embeds or implements; the more such business logic is built into uncontrolled or unmanaged apps or tools, the greater the risk of something going wrong in undetected ways. Thus, option A is not a probable risk; option B seems to have a lot of frequent, intensive reviews of the results of these queries, which would need to correlate or compare with what the production information systems would show. Option C implements customer relationship management and systems/product maintenance business logic; option D seems to circumvent information classification, segregation of duties, and other access control principles. Both options C and D bear close watching.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0057">&#13;
<p class="listPara1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_lxii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="lxii"/>D. Option A is false; no such agreements apply worldwide. At best, regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) apply to EU member states. Option B is true as far as it goes, but with a catch: if the organization guesses wrong, it could end up in serious legal trouble in multiple jurisdictions. Option C is false; storage of data in a center in another country must involve movement of data from your jurisdiction into the one the datacenter is in, and movement in the reverse direction when you need to use the backup. In almost all cases, data protection laws and regulations apply to data in use, at rest, and in motion. Option D correctly illustrates the need to ensure that professional ethics have a voice in making risk management decisions.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0058">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B, C. Phishing and many other social engineering tactics have played a major role in more than 60 percent of major data breaches in the past few years. Such tactics have high payoff to the attacker during their search for a possible target, gathering information about its systems and security, and then their initial entry into the target's systems. Thus, options A and D are likely phases for phishing attacks and incorrect answers to this question (note the “not make use”). Options B and C are almost exclusively done surreptitiously, exploiting information that social engineering may have revealed to the attacker; few if any signs of phishing in these activities have been noted.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0059">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. Starting with option A is a commonsense approach to quickly implementing some reasonable and prudent protection, but it lacks any judgment as to which vulnerabilities are important to your organization's risk management strategy and which are not. Option B is the systems inventory, and you will need it because it describes the as-built systems. Option C is what drives option D. Therefore, start shopping for countermeasures with option D in hand.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0060">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B, C. Option A is false; Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) by itself cannot trigger a device to download and install a firmware patch file. Option D is false, because that operator action can be misdirected to use the wrong file as the update. Option B may be true in some cases, if the device is set to allow remote management from other than a connected endpoint system such as a laptop or smartphone. Attacks like those in option C happen a lot!</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0061">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. While some zero day exploits have been discovered and exploited within the same day, typically after the release of a new software product to the market, attackers need to spend considerable time on most newly discovered vulnerabilities to understand them well enough to design an exploit against them and then find a suitable target. So, option A is not correct. Option B incorrectly refers to exploits that leave behind payloads or features that will take action later. Option C incorrectly associates the media reporting of cybersecurity, in general, with the time from discovery to exploitation of a vulnerability.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0062">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. Since TPMs are special, sealed hardware modules added to the motherboards of computers or phones by their manufacturers, option D is incorrect, even though TPM device driver software must be incorporated into most OSs to enable their use. Option A is incorrect; the TPM doesn't simplify this but allows for a more trustworthy hardware storage and management of certificates, digital signatures, and so forth. Option C is not correct; these functions in the OS and host hardware remain, while all the TPM provides is its own implementations with which it secures keys, manages certificates, and hashes (preserves) machine identification information.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0063">&#13;
<p class="listPara1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_lxiii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="lxiii"/>A. Options B, C, and D all are parts of what cryptography entails and taken together sum it up. Option A is more suggestive of camouflage, honeypots, or other efforts to draw attackers away from what you want to defend and divert their energies elsewhere, which do not directly involve the use of encryption, hashing, and so forth.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0064">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. Option A is an incomplete description of asymmetric encryption; option C is false, since hybrid systems are in widespread use; and option D is unrelated to symmetric or asymmetric encryption.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0065">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. Options A, B, and C are correct. Option D seems to confuse aspects of access control systems, which do have to keep track of—that is, account for—access attempts and allowed accesses.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0066">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. While option A is tempting, cryptographic processes cannot confirm that the certificate and key are correctly associated with a specific human or organization. The certificate authority (CA) does that through other (noncryptographic) means and, as an anchor in the chain of trust, attests that this person and this certificate go together. Thus, option D is correct. Option B refers to integrity and option C to confidentiality, which are not directly part of nonrepudiation.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0067">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">C. The incorrect answers show misapplication of the steps of the process. Option A has reversed who encrypts and who decrypts. Option B confuses the use of the sender's public and private key, and if the recipient knows the sender's private key, it must no longer be private. Option D won't work, because decrypting the unencrypted hash won't produce anything that is useful.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0068">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. Subjects, by definition, want to <i>do something</i> that involves an <i>object</i>. Thus, option A has these roles reversed. Subjects can be any kind of entity that can take action. Objects contain information but also can provide requested services—that is, take action upon request—so options B and C are correct.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0069">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. The reference monitor is the functionality that checks every access attempt to see if it should be authorized or denied. As a result, option D is false (accounting is a recordkeeping function, necessary to access control but done after the access request is granted or denied). Option C is false, since the reference monitor is in fact implemented in operating systems (typically in their security kernel) or as part of a trusted computing base (TCB) module on a motherboard. Option B is the reverse of what's required; we need to be able to inspect, analyze, and verify that the logic and code of the reference monitor does its job completely and correctly and that it does nothing else if we are to consider it highly trustworthy.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0070">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B, D. Mandatory access control policies do not allow subjects or objects to modify the security-related aspects of the system, its subjects, and its objects; thus, granting the privileges in option A or C cannot be allowed. Options B and D reflect reasonable and prudent access control checks that all systems should perform before granting access but that are not part of mandatory access control policies.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0071">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. Item 1, proofing, is part of provisioning, and thus options A and C are incorrect. Item 5, deletion, happens after revocation, but it is a cleanup of files, assets, and records, and is more properly part of a records retention and housekeeping process. It is not part of identity management per se. Thus, option D is incorrect. Option B correctly reflects that we start by provisioning an identity, we continually review the privileges assigned to it versus the needs of the job and the organization, and then we revoke it.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0072">&#13;
<p class="listPara1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_lxiv" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="lxiv"/>D. Option D is highly risky and therefore correct: plugging a device into an empty network connection should start a connection handshake that is an opportunity to block an unknown or unauthorized device from joining the network. Options A and C are parts of how option B performs such an authentication, and therefore option B is the most secure approach of the three.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0073">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. A positive result of an authentication test means that the claimant is who (or what) they claim to be. Thus, a false positive is allowing an incorrect identity to access the system, which probably is a threat actor. A negative result denies an identity's claim to be who (or what) they claim to be. Therefore, a false negative denies a legitimate identity from system access. As a result, options A and D incorrectly use the concept of negative and positive authentication results (correct and false). While option C is true, option B indicates the situation of greatest risk—a threat actor has been legitimized and granted access.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0074">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. Option A is false; each additional factor checked increases the challenge an attacker has to overcome to spoof an identity claim. Option C is false; hardware is needed only for factors involving what the subject has, such as a keyfob code generator or biometric factors. Option D is tempting, and high-risk functions might be best protected with additional security measures, but compared to option B, it is not as compellingly correct.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0075">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. Option D accurately reflects the use of both of these as conceptual models and protocol stacks—by builders, attackers, and defenders alike. Option A reflects an incorrect bias of many network engineers who somewhat dismissively ignore things above the Transport layer. Option B is incorrect, because both models drive the design and use of hardware, software, control, and systems management information. Option C is incorrect, since all three sets of concepts drive the design and operation of real hardware, software, and systems.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0076">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. Option B is incorrect, because the changes in address field sizes, and therefore packet header structures, have nothing to do with security (although IPv6 does provide enhancements to security). Option C is incorrect; such a conversion could be done by a gateway, but that is not part of IPv6, although IPv6 supports it. Option D is incorrect, although the transport protocols (like TCP and UDP) have not changed, but this is not where the incompatibility comes from.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0077">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. Options A and C both incorrectly leave out subnetting in IPv6 and misstate what classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) is about, even though the two options say different incorrect things about CIDR. Option D is partly correct in that IPv6 does have a 16-bit subnet field, and as option B says, the overall address field size makes subnetting much easier to do, but there is no subnet field in IPv4.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0078">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A, D. Ports are a fundamental part of the way apps request services from processes running on other nodes on the Internet. Standardized port numbers make applications designs easier to manage; thus, port 80 and HTTP are associated with each other. Therefore, options A and D show a misunderstanding of what ports are and why they are necessary.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0079">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. From the Physical layer on up, the injection of unauthorized traffic into a network can cause almost any protocol to fall for a “mistaken identity” that leads to an MITM attack. Session stealing (Layers 5 and 7) is a prime example, making option A false. Option C is incorrect, since IP (Layer 2) is inherently connectionless and prone to MITM attacks. Option D is also false, as session stealing (and others) demonstrates.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0080">&#13;
<p class="listPara1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_lxv" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="lxv"/>B. Option A misstates the role of ongoing monitoring and conflicts with option B. Option C suggests a redundant set of capabilities, which may be mission critical for a select few organizations but is not common. Option D may be a useful capability, but it is not the reason for ongoing monitoring.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0081">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. If option A or C was plausible, then you wouldn't actually have a gap. Option D correctly defines the gap but fails to look to how to mitigate the risk posed by the gap.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0082">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. Fixing or applying patches to eliminate a vulnerability is the definition of remediating, mitigating, fixing, or repairing a vulnerability.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0083">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A, B, C. Option D is typically an example of remediating, sometimes called fixing or mitigating the risk.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0084">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">C. Option B does correctly state the risk that attackers may know more about your systems than you do, if you haven't thoroughly checked CVE data as part of your vulnerabilities assessment. But it incorrectly goes on to suggest that you fix these first—they may not relate to your organization's highest-priority impacts as spelled out by the BIA. Option A is therefore false. Option D is also false, since even the most Linux-based of organizations will probably have non-Linux systems elements (such as network components) that CVE could have information about.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0085">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. Improving product quality is a laudable goal, but in and of itself it is not related to information systems security; thus, option A is incorrect. Option B refers to activities after an incident; mitigation activities happen before an incident occurs or result from lessons learned because of the incident. Option C is most likely being done to implement new or revised security policies. Option D is part of information risk management and should precede information risk mitigation.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0086">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">C. Option D incorrectly has the BIA first when it has to come after the organization's leadership has agreed to risk tolerance and set priorities. Option B is incorrect, partly because the basic “commonsense” posture is not part of a formal risk management process but a bare minimum immediate set of actions to take if needed. Option A has establishing a posture (which is policy and decisions that drive implementation and operation steps) and implementation in the wrong order.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0087">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. Option B is the simplest and most effective definition of information risk. Options A and C do not include probability of occurrence (risks are not certain to happen) and describe how risks become events rather than what the risk actually is. Option D is one example, but it does not define information risk.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0088">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. Proactive means (thinking ahead and planning for contingencies), rather than reactive (waiting until things break). Option A is both wrong and probably illegal in most circumstances. Option B might be true, but it is a general statement about “being proactive” rather than specifically about information security. Option C describes an integrated information security management approach.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0089">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A, B. Option C is the safeguard value, which we cannot compute until we have completed risk assessment and vulnerability assessment and then designed, specified, or selected such controls or countermeasures. Option D is typically not the loss incurred by damage of an asset; of greater interest regarding impact to an asset would be the cost to repair it (if repairable), replace it, or design and implement new processes to do without it.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0090">&#13;
<p class="listPara1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_lxvi" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="lxvii"/>C. Options A and D reflect biases toward or against qualitative assessments (presumably for being “soft” or potentially based on emotions or intuition) or quantitative ones (the data is too hard to get or validate). Using published common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) information can be quite illuminating, but as in option D, be careful to not just assume that other people's experiences and systems are a good match for your own or to bow to authoritative statements without carefully considering whether they fit your situation.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0091">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">C. Option B has the annual rate of occurrence (ARO) use incorrect; if the ARO was less than 1, the single loss expectancy is in effect spread over multiple years (as if it were amortized). Option A involves restore time and point objectives, which are not involved in the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) calculation. Option D misunderstands ALE = ARO * SLE (single loss expectancy) as the basic math involved.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0092">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. Option A is a misstatement of RTO and RPO.</p></li>&#13;

<p class="listPara1">B. Item 3, perspective, should reflect priorities, risk appetite or tolerance, and decision-making culture, and this has to lead all risk management activities. Next comes Item 4, which feeds into the BIA. Item 2 should be a product of the business impact analysis (BIA) process, because it combines costs or magnitude of impacts with acceptable damage limitation strategies. Finally, we choose what to fix, transfer (pay someone else to worry about), accept, or avoid, and any residual risk is recast or re-expressed to reflect these decisions.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0094">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A, B, C. Option D is incorrect; almost everything that holds our IT world together is done via directly building protocols into hardware and software. Options A, B, and C are correct and show the human social communications need for signaling each other about the communication we're trying to achieve.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0095">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">D. Options A and C are confusing information, and our systems or processes for using it, with the technologies with which we create, store, and use that information. Option B is a partial answer (it does not address anything other than confidentiality) and might be true, but this is a decision that company leadership and management should make (on advice from the SSCP). Option D is most complete and correct.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0096">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">B. Option A incorrectly ignores that failures in security design or practice can lead to data input or systems usage that might be safe and reliable tomorrow, for example, but not today. Option C, true as far as it goes, does not address security at all. Option D incorrectly ignores that the vulnerability assessments that should drive security measures are all based on consequences if the risk becomes real.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0097">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">C. Options A and B are both examples of due care; due diligence is the verification that all is being done well and nothing is not done properly. Option D can be an important part of due diligence, but it is missing the potential for follow-up action.</p></li>&#13;

<p class="listPara1">B. Disclosure of intellectual property in unauthorized ways can end up giving away any competitive advantage that IP might have had for the business.</p></li>&#13;

<p class="listPara1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_lxvii" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="lxvii"/>D. If the equipment cannot run because there is no power, then no data stored in it can be displayed, printed, or shared with users—data is not available. Some transactions may have to be recovered and rerun once the power comes back up and everything is turned on again, but only if transactions were lost completely would there be a data integrity concern.</p></li>&#13;
<li id="f05-ex-0100">&#13;
<p class="listPara1">A. Keeping information secret means agreeing to limit or control how (or if) that information can be passed on to others. Privacy is the freedom from intrusion into your own affairs, person, property, or ideas. The other options either confuse confidentiality with privacy or do not use the concepts correctly.</p></li>&#13;
